# FLOX Interpreter - WIP

An adaptation of the interpreter for the jlox language from 'Crafting Interpreters' written in F#. This is a learning project and will contain non-idiomatic code. The purpose is to create a working interpreter while sticking to a functional paradigm.

## How to build it

Use Visual Studio or
```
dotnet build path_to_interpreter_solution
```

## How to use it

```
FLOXInterprepeter.exe 'path_to_source' // for a source file
FLOXInterprepeter.exe // for interactive prompt
```
